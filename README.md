### If You Can't Beat Em, Join 'Em

Sooper harnesses the power of Google Adsense to generate charitable donations, at no cost to you! All profits receieved from Sooper's traffic, go directly
to a selected charity. Therefore, Sooper depends on the power of internet users to visit and share Sooper. Each year, Sooper's developers will select 
a new charity to support. Our hope is in the future, Sooper's community will vote directly on charities to support.

Although we are currently applying for the Google AdSense Program, Sooper hopes to begin making donations soon. According to Google estimates, 50,000 monthly
visitors could generate up to 6.6k in charitable donations.

### Proof
Once Sooper begins making donations, ALL donation reciepts will all be stored under the Proof tab. This way, you can be sure your visits are making a difference!
